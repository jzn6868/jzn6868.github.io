I am currently a third-year Master’s student at Northwest University, and I expect to graduate in June 2026.</p> <p>My research investigates how human transcription factors shape DNA-binding specificity under epigenomic regulation. I study how chromatin context influences transcription factor binding behavior and regulatory precision. My work focuses on high-throughput SELEX and ChIP-based approaches to dissect how chromatin states modulate transcription factor binding specificity.</p> <p>Beyond the laboratory, I enjoy producing hip-hop beats, running, hiking, and photography. These creative and physical pursuits help me maintain balance and inspiration in scientific research.</p> </body></html>
